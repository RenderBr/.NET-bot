# .NET-bot
A .NET 7 console application that allows you to interface with ChatGPT-3.5-turbo

## How does it work?
Using the Betalgo.OpenAI.GPT3 nuget package, we are able to interface with OpenAI and use it's various models. In the future, I may allow the use of other models (besides CGPT-3.5-turbo) but for now this is all.

- You **NEED** an API Key for this to work. You can get one here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

## Where do I download?
Download any of the corresponding releases based on your OS. [Click here to visit the release page.](https://github.com/RenderBr/.NET-bot/releases/)
